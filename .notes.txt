issues:
When you do: "set settingname"  is breaks the program needing a reset to the default settings.




ideas:
Make a minimum MMR that can be achieved so that players who are especially unlucky can eventually recover their rank.
This option could be enabled or disabled as well as the MMR being able to be changed.  Maybe it could be set to 0 MMR, or maybe 500 or 1000 or something.

Instead of using squadsInQue containing all the players, I'd like to make it where I can have a database with maybe a million players, then I can randomly keep added players to
squadsInQue to make for faster processing and a larger test dataset.
(I realize that Queue is how it is spelled, but I made that typo a while ago, and it has just stuck around due to time.)

People who are playing in lobbies much higher than their rank will lose less, and gain more MMR points per game.  This will allow for them to
catch up with whoever they are playing with who is gaining and losing at the normal rate.


suggestions from people: 

cheaters vs cheaters?
high Winstreaks vs winstreaks
comment a person named iso_R6 on twitch:
"I havent read anything but maybe something that matchmakes winning streaks against each other more often and losing streaks more often,
or puts people who are on opposite streaks on the same time"


observations: 
With random MMR handed out at the start, it does become a bell curve over time. Even without manipulating MMR for players based off
of the oposite team.  I would not have thought that.  I suppose that is the antiboosting system calculating the average vss the actual average.
